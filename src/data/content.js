    description: 'The main aim of this platform was to bring the existing students of IIT Roorkee close to the freshers so that the freshers can get a proper insight on the Institute. The environment of this place is quite different from what they have yet experienced. This is true, both for the freshers and their parents. This platform would help the students clarify any doubts that they have regarding various aspects of the Institute by creating a link between them and the existing students.',

    description: 'This was my first project as a member of IMG. The android app was aimed to provide the basic features of viewing the notices which were basically PDFs. The notices are categorized under Departments and Institute Authorities. The navigation drawer is the primary navigation medium. The app was designed to be a Minimum Value Product due to the restriction on the time to be spent on its development. The next revision of the app was planned out in the sext semester with the inclusion of various primary user based features like making bookmarks, push notification customization, create events and set reminders. The re-design of this app is discussed in the next article.',
