    description: 'In agency, the same question has to be answered each year: how to wish the clients a happy new year ? After the huge success of its 2016 wishes, Make Me Pulse was highly anticipated. With the central message that &apos;Good ideas are made to be experienced&apos;, we decided to present several scenes containing revolutionary inventions, with which we could interact.&#10;&#10;    I was Lead DA on this project, so I decided to imagine and model many 3D objects to illustrate each of the inventions within a colorful universe, contrasting with the 2016 b&amp;w Wishes. Developers then used these 3D objects to add some interaction, and magic. To start 2017 well.',

    description: 'This was my first project as a member of IMG. The android app was aimed to provide the basic features of viewing the notices which were basically PDFs. The notices are categorized under Departments and Institute Authorities. The navigation drawer is the primary navigation medium. The app was designed to be a Minimum Value Product due to the restriction on the time to be spent on its development. The next revision of the app was planned out in the sext semester with the inclusion of various primary user based features like making bookmarks, push notification customization, create events and set reminders. The re-design of this app is discussed in the next article.',
